# U.F.O-Conqueror
U.F.O Conqueror is a fun and intuitive arcade game that takes modern game concepts and the looks of retro games and fits them together in one gaming experience. The player controls a spaceship that travels through space and time to fight and defeat aliens. The player uses a laser beam of light, powerups, and tactical movements to re-conquer the Milky Way Galaxy. The player has unlimited laser beam fuel but only 10 health points. The player has to use their gaming skills to defeat three U.F.O henchmen and the U.F.O. boss to win the game. If the player loses their health points at the hands of the enemy, they lose the game. The game is built using a Carnegie Mellon's Python Module.
